    <h1>Welcome to CardMirror!</h1>
    <p>CardMirror is an online deck building and comparison tool.</p>
    <p>Ever thought "I wonder if I could turn a bunch of cards I already own into a playable deck, without buying new cards"? CardMirror quickly compares your collection against deck lists that you save to quickly and easily figure out if you can turn your large unused pile of cards into something usable!</p>
    
    <h2>Recommended Use for CardMirror</h2>
    <p>Use alongside your collection tool (e.g. Moxfield if you're playing Magic the Gathering), and copy paste in deck lists as you browse. CardMirror will then display as a percentage, the amount of cards that you own in the decklist.</p>
    <p>e.g. in the below results, I was comparing a Pirate Deck, and Elf Deck, and a Landfall Deck. I already own 90% of the cards in the pirate deck list, and only 50% in the Elf and 20% in the Landfall. So, I think I'll go ahead and build that pirate deck.</p>
