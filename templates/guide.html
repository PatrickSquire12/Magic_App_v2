        <p class="mb-4">CardMirror is an online deck building and comparison tool.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">Ever thought "I wonder if I could turn a bunch of cards I already own into a playable deck, without buying new cards"? CardMirror quickly compares the cards in your collection against other deck lists, helping you figure out if you can turn your large unused pile of cards into something usable!</p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Recommended Use for CardMirror</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">Use alongside your collection tool (such as Moxfield if you're playing Magic the Gathering), and copy paste in deck lists as you browse. CardMirror will then display as a percentage, the amount of cards that you own in the decklist.</p>
